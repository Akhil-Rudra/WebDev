        Interstate 69 in Michigan enters that state south of Coldwater and passes the cities of Lansing and Flint in the
        Lower Peninsula. I-69 is a part of the Interstate Highway System, and will eventually run from the Mexican
        border in Texas to the Canadian border at Port Huron, Michigan.
    </div>
    <div id="two">
        A north–south freeway from the Indiana–Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east–west
        after running concurrently with I-96. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of
        the twin-span Blue Water Bridge while running concurrently with I-94 at the border.
    </div>
    <div id="three">
        There are four related business loops for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities.
        Predecessors to I-69 include the first M-29, US Highway 27 (US 27), M-78 and M-21. The freeway was not included
        on the original Interstate Highway System planning maps in the mid-1950s, but it was added in 1958 along a
        shorter route.
